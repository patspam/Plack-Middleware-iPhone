DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::iPhone does some silly rewriting of any html content
    returned by your app (mostly just the head block) to make it play nicer
    with iPhones. This is just a toy, for real <HTML5> mobile web apps you
    should be writing the HTML yourself.

    (freely available).

  OPTIONS
   icon
    A 57x57 image icon that the iPhone will display as a shortcut to your
    app if you add it to your Home Screen via the "Add to Home Screen"
    function.

   startup_image
    A 320x460 PNG image that is displayed while your app is loading. If this
    is not set, the iPhone automatically uses a screenshot of the most
    recent app state.

   statusbar
    Sets the "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" meta tag, which
    controls the status bar appearance when yourself app is launched from a
    Home icon shortcut.

    Valid options are:

    *   gray (default)

    *   black

    *   black-translucent

   viewport
    Sets the viewport meta tag, which determines how wide your iPhone thinks
    the screen is and scaling options.

    See <Configuring the Viewport> for more information.

   manifest
    Plack::Middleware::iPhone automatically generates a manifest file for
    your application (called "app.manifest") once, at compile time. This
    currently cannot be disabled.

    The manifest is only actually used if you set this option, which causes
    the "manifest" attribute to be set on your html tag, thus triggering
    your iPhone to enable offline caching.

    See <Going Offline> for more information

   tidy
    Run the HTML through HTML::Tidy
