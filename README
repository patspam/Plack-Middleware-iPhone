DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::iPhone does on-the-fly rewriting of any html content
    returned by your app (mostly just the head block) to make it play nicer
    with iPhones.

    This is a borderline ACME movile. For real <HTML5> mobile web apps you
    should be writing the HTML yourself.

    (freely available).

  OPTIONS
   icon
    A 57x57 image icon that the iPhone will display as a shortcut to your
    app if you add it to your Home Screen via the "Add to Home Screen"
    function.

   startup_image
    A 320x460 PNG image that is displayed while your app is loading. If this
    is not set, the iPhone automatically uses a screenshot of the most
    recent app state.

   statusbar
    Sets the "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" meta tag, which
    controls the status bar appearance when yourself app is launched from a
    Home icon shortcut.

    Valid options are:

    *   gray (default)

    *   black

    *   black-translucent

   viewport
    Sets the viewport meta tag, which determines how wide your iPhone thinks
    the screen is and scaling options.

    See <Configuring the Viewport> for more information.

   manifest
    Automatically generates a manifest file for your application (with
    whatever name you pass in), and sets the "manifest" attribute on the
    html root tag, which triggers your iPhone to start using offline HTML
    Web App caching.

    See <Going Offline> for more information

   tidy
    Run the HTML through HTML::Tidy
